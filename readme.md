# Programmatic Problem Solving

Many times, when someone is struggling with programming it is because of how they approach solving the problem. It's very easy overlook mental shortcuts our brain takes but that a computer can't, this leads to many of the difficulties when coding. This repo is a collection of resources for teaching a methodical approach to solving programming problems.
